# UFC Dashboard — working notes for Claude / contributors

A vanilla PWA: the entire app is **`index.html`** (HTML + inline CSS + ~5,600
lines of inline JS), fed by **`data.js`** (the generated `EVENTS` array) and
served **raw from the repo root** to GitHub Pages. Backend logic lives in
**`supabase/functions/*/index.ts`** (Deno edge functions; `ai-breakdown` calls
the paid Anthropic API). Python (`scrape.py`) generates the data.

## ⛔ Before you commit or push ANY change, run `npm run verify`

Because everything is one inline-JS file, a single typo turns the whole app
into a blank white page for every user. Once, a break shipped mid-fight-card
and stayed live while people were using it. Don't let that happen again.

```
npm run verify
```

runs three gates (all fast, all local):

| script                | catches                                                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run check:web`   | syntax errors in inline scripts / `sw.js`; broken/empty `data.js` |
| `npm run check:functions` | syntax errors in any Supabase edge function (incl. the paid one) |
| `npm run smoke`       | the app failing to **boot** — loads it headlessly and opens the leaderboard |

**Never push a change that fails `verify`.** If you touched `index.html`,
`data.js`, `sw.js`, or a function, verify is mandatory — not optional.

First run needs dev deps: `npm install` (browser download is skipped if
`PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` is set; otherwise `npx playwright install chromium`).

## Deploys are gated on the same checks

Pushing to `main` deploys automatically, so the gates also run in CI and
**block the deploy on failure** — a broken build can't reach production:

- `.github/workflows/pages.yml` → GitHub Pages. `deploy` **needs** the
  `validate` job (the `validate-web.yml` reusable workflow = the checks above).
- `.github/workflows/deploy-functions.yml` → Supabase. `deploy` **needs** a
  `check:functions` gate.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs everything on every push/PR for visibility.

CI is a backstop, not a substitute: run `verify` locally first so you never
spend a debug cycle discovering a break in CI (or worse, in prod).

## Other conventions

- **Bump `SW_VERSION` in `sw.js`** whenever you change `index.html` / `data.js`
  so installed PWAs fetch the new version instead of a cached broken one.
- `build.mjs` (`npm run build`) writes an optional minified `dist/`; the live
  deploy serves raw source, so a change isn't "shipped" via the build.
- Edge-function edits only go live after a Supabase deploy (the workflow above),
  not merely on git push.
